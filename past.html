                <p class="text1">I went to a Chinese local school in Kelantan, Malaysia for 6 years. After that, I went to Uplands international school in Penang. 
                    I was in middle school for 4 years and after I received my IGCSE results. I went to INTI international college in Penang. 
                    While I was waiting for my IGCSE results, I was working as a waiter at a restaurant. I also worked as an IGCSE tutor for Maths 
                    and Science. I stopped being a waiter when high school was about to begin but I continued my job as a tutor for another 5 months. 
                    I took HSC during my high school for 1 year, graduated with an ATAR I'm satisfied with, then head into UTS.

                        <p>As of today 4/5/2021, I have only 2 weeks knowledge of HTML. However, I have learnt a lot of tags since then. This 
                            website will be a showcase of some of my HTML skill.

                        <p>Similarly to HTML, my knowledge of CSS tags are growing and this website is a proof of it. However, since this 
                            website is withheld from using certain tags and styling, this website is essentially 70% of the things I can do. For now.

                        <p> I did not choose to do Additional Mathematics when I was in middle school. However, 1 year before the final exam, I decided to
                            learn Add Maths. So, I spent the whole of Christmas to self teach myself Add Maths. 5 months later, the final IGCSE exam was here 
                            and I managed to pull off a stunning 97 percent on my Add Maths test. Pure hardwork and dedication is what I'm really proud of.

                            family save some finance for other needs and wants.
