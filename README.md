# Benz' Website

1st Year 1st Semester - Web Systems.

This was my VERY first website. With no prior knowledge to HTML and CSS, I went through extensive research to learn the fundamentals of website development, design heuristics and usability heuristics. 

This website contains all HTML and CSS written by me (which does not adopt best practices) and no use of Bootstrap. This website took me 20 hours in total (inclusive research) to make.
